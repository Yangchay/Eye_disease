### Project Topic: Eye Disease Detector


## Description

The Eye Disease Detector is an AI-powered system that uses deep learning to analyze retinal i
mages and automatically detect common eye conditions such as diabetic_retinopathy, 
cataracts, glaucoma, and normal. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) 
or pre-trained models like ResNet or EfficientNet, the detector can classify diseases
with high accuracy, supporting early diagnosis and timely treatment. Designed to 
assist ophthalmologists and improve healthcare access in remote or underserved areas,
this tool offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for preventing avoidable vision loss.
