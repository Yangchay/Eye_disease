### Project Topic: Eye Disease Detector


## Description

The Eye Disease Detector is an AI-powered system that uses deep learning to analyze retinal eye
mages and automatically detect common eye conditions such as diabetic_retinopathy, 
cataracts, glaucoma, and normal. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
the detector can classify diseases with high accuracy, supporting early diagnosis and 
timely treatment. Designed to assist ophthalmologists and improve healthcare access in 
remote or underserved areas, this tool offers a scalable and cost-effective 
solution for preventing avoidable vision loss.

This application uses advanced artificial intelligence to detect potential eye diseases from retinal or eye scan images. Upload an image, and our model will analyze it for signs of conditions such as glaucoma, cataract, and diabetic retinopathy.
✅ How to use:
Click the Choose File button to upload an eye image (JPG or PNG).
Make sure the image is clear and not blurry.
Click Detect Disease to run the analysis.
Wait a few seconds for the results to be displayed.
